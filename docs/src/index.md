## Features

!!! note 
    The package is still under active development and things evolve quickly (or at least should)

- enclosure of the solution of interval linear systems
- exact characterization of the solution set of interval linear systems using Oettli-Pr√§ger
- verified solution of floating point linear systems
- enclosure of eigenvalues of interval matrices
- verified computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of floating point matrices

# Some sample Plot experiment

<!-- using Plots

plot(1:100) -->
