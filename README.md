# MyFunRep

## Overview

This package contains routines to perform numerical linear algebra using interval arithmetic. This can be used both for rigorous computations and uncertainty propagation.

## Features

**Note**: The package is still under active development and things evolve quickly (or at least should)

- enclosure of the solution of interval linear systems
- exact characterization of the solution set of interval linear systems using Oettli-Pr√§ger
- verified solution of floating point linear systems
- enclosure of eigenvalues of interval matrices
- verified computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of floating point matrices

## Installation

Open a Julia session and enter

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("MyFunRep")
```

this will download the package and all the necessary dependencies for you. Next you can import the package with

```julia
using MyFunRep
```

and you are ready to go.
